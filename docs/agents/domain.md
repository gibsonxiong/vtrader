# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. Also check context-scoped ADRs at `<context>/docs/adr/`.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront.

## File structure (multi-context)

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md                   ← root index of contexts
├── docs/adr/                        ← system-wide decisions
├── frontend/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── docs/adr/
├── backend/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── docs/adr/
└── shared/
    ├── CONTEXT.md
    └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
